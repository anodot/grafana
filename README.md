# Grafana Data Source Plugin Template

This is Anodot Datasource Plugin for Grafana, which together with Anodot Panel Plugin allows users to use Anodot data for building Grafana Dashboards. 

## What is Grafana Data Source Plugin?
Grafana supports a wide range of data sources, including Prometheus, MySQL, and even Datadog. There’s a good chance you can already visualize metrics from the systems you have set up. In some cases, though, you already have an in-house metrics solution that you’d like to add to your Grafana dashboards. Grafana Data Source Plugins enables integrating such solutions with Grafana.
